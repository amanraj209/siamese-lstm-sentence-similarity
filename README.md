# Siamese LSTM For Sentence Similarity

A siamese recurrent architecture to learn semantic sentence similarity is implemented using Manhattan distance as a distance metric between pairwise representation of sentences. 

The model is trained and tested on Quora Question Pair Dataset with test accuracy of 82%.
